fear	6380	in my childhood home my kitchen led on to my bathroom, with the fridge located just behind the door that led into the bathroom. One time when I was aged 7 or 8, in the middle of the night I was thirsty so I went downstairs to get a drink from the fridge. I knew my father was up and he was using the toilet in the bathroom in the next room. As I shut the fridge after I had got the juice out, my dad was finished in the bathroom and opened the door. He must have heard the fridge shut, but because of the layout of the kitchen, I was hidden behind the door. (me and my dad were stood side by side but the open door was in between us if that makes sense). Everything fell silent and the next thing I know my dad has swung a fist around the door and abruptly stopped when he realised it was me in the kitchen, not a burglar that had got caught hiding! I dropped my juice on the floor out of absolute fear of my 40 year old dad punching me in the face!

fear	6388	I felt fear when I was told that I would need an emergency caesarean section when I was in labour at my first born son. I had my heart set on a natural water birth and I was dead set against having a section if at all possible so my heart sank and it filled me with fear and dread. I had never been in hospital overnight before or had any kind of surgery so the idea of surgery itself scared me but the realisation that it affected both me and my unborn son scared me even more. I then felt more fear when I had to sign my consent saying that the hospital weren't responsibly if I died. My fear then increased when I was told I'd need to be put under by general anaesthetic. Putting the mask on was probably the scariest experience I've ever had.	I felt fear when I was told that I would need an emergency caesarean section when I was in labour at my first born son.
